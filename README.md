# autonomous-feedback-loop-for-self-optimization
Develop an AI-driven feedback mechanism that enables continuous self-improvement by autonomously identifying inefficiencies, learning from past behaviors, and implementing corrective measures in real-time. This system will monitor its own performance metrics and adapt to maintain optimal functionality.
